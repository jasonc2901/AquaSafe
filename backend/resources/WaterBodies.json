However, the total length of the River Bann, including its path through the 30 km (19 mi) long Lough Neagh is 159 km (99 mi). Another length of the River Bann given is 90 mi. The river winds its way from the southeast corner of Northern Ireland to the northwest coast, pausing in the middle to widen into the enormous Lough Neagh. The River Bann catchment has an area of 5,775 km2. The River Bann has a mean discharge rate of 92 m3/s. According to C.Michael Hogan, the Bann River Valley is a settlement area for some of the first human arrivals in Ireland after the most recent glacial retreat. The river has played an important part in the industrialisation of the north of Ireland, especially in the linen industry. Today salmon and eel fisheries are the most important economic features of the river. The river is often used as a dividing line between the eastern and western areas of Northern Ireland, often labelled the 'Bann divide'",

The river then enters a long west–east valley guarded on the south by the Comeraghs and limestone lowlands on the north. In the 1760s the river was made navigable to Clonmel, but the tidal limit is Carrick-on-Suir. Finally the river broadens into an estuary and passes through Waterford. A little farther east, after a course of 114 mi (183 km), the Suir is joined by the Barrow and the Nore. All three rivers enter the wide estuarine bay known as Waterford Harbour.",

It is 87 miles long and drains a total catchment of 977 square miles. It rises on a sandstone base but the catchment soon turns to limestone and remains so to the sea. The countryside is one of mixed farming, with some tillage, quite a bit of pasture and dairying and some bloodstock. The river has a fairly steep gradient but the flow is checked by innumerable weirs and it is probably true to say that shallow glides are the predominant feature.",

It turns westward in a steep torrential course to the Glen of Imail, a granite basin 500–700 feet (150–215 m) above sea level and runs south through the farmed lowlands of County Carlow to Bunclody, where it is joined by the Clody and continues southeast through the Slaney Gap. It receives two major tributaries, the Derry, above Bunclody, and the Bann, north of Enniscorthy, where the river becomes tidal. Quays were built there in the 19th century for barge traffic to Wexford. The Slaney finally enters Wexford Harbour, a sheltered inlet of more importance for shipping in the 19th century than at present. Its length is 73 miles (118 km).",

Historically the Ballisodare River was never known as a salmon river and records in relation to salmon catches prior to 1850 would indicate that less than 20 salmon were caught in the river system in any year. The simple reason for this was that salmon had to negotiate a waterfall in excess of twenty feet high right at the mouth of the river to reach the lower stretches of the river, and a further set of falls at Collooney barred their passage to the Owenmore River.",

It begins as little more than a ditch as it exits the Corrib River but by the time it reaches its end in Terryland it has split into two streams and appears in places to be between 4 and 6 feet deep, and this although no tributaries feed into it. This is most likely because as it passes through an extensive, marshy plain it is fed by a number of underground springs. The surprise is saved for the end when after splitting in two, and being at its deepest, its two forks dive underground and disappear.",

It is bounded in the east by the underfit Moygannon River and in the west by a minor stream. The ridge consists of around 4 poorly marked cross-valley frontal moraines which are more clearly defined on the valley sides as discontinuous round-crested ridges and benches. Minor exposures indicate that the ridge contains gravely diamict. Lateral moraine benches and subdued hummocks trend northward along the flanks of streamlined hills on the western side of the valley. Two well-marked cross-valley arcs at Aghavilly have sharply defined, steep, distal and proximal slopes.",

The very progressive Agivey Anglers association has worked tirelessly over the past number of years to create many good holding pools, and spawning grounds further up the river. Although not a spate river, it has spate-like qualities in that it drops off quickly after a flood. Still, it remains fishable, even in low water.",

It is estimated that there are more than 130 miles of tributaries, which flow into the Moyola. Like many other rivers, these upper reaches are the destination of migrating salmon and dollaghan, with many miles of spawing beds in both the main river and tributaries.",

From the foothills of the mountain to its final entry into Lough Neagh, it is probably not more than 13 miles (21 kms) in length.  In many respects the Crumlin River is typical of the hundreds of small rivers that flow throughout the island of Ireland, holding a good stock of native brown trout in small pools and stretches of fast running streams. However, in late summer and early autumn, the Crumlin River benefits from a run of dollaghan (Lough Neagh trout) and the occasional salmon – mostly in the lower pools and stretches.",

         "Description": "The River Erne, in the northwest of Ireland, is the second-longest river in Ulster. It rises on the east shoulder of Slieve Glah mountain three miles south of Cavan in County Cavan and flows 80 miles (129km) through Lough Gowna, Lough Oughter and Upper and Lower Lough Erne, County Fermanagh, to the sea at Ballyshannon, County Donegal. For 30 miles from Crossdoney in County Cavan to Enniskillen in County Fermanagh, it is difficult to distinguish the river as it winds its way through interconnected loughs or parts of loughs nestling among the drumlin hills of Cavan and south Fermanagh. The river is 120 kilometres long and is very popular for fly fishing for trout and salmon, with a number of fisheries along both the river itself and its tributaries. The town of Enniskillen is mostly situated on an island in the river, between Upper and Lower Lough Erne. It is linked to the River Shannon by the Shannon–Erne Waterway. The total catchment area of the River Erne is 4,372 km2.",

While the Newry River flows under the famous Newry Town Hall, according to the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland, the Clanrye breaks away from the Newry River near Drummillar. The Clanrye then progresses under the main Belfast to Dublin A1 road at Sheepbridge and onward toward the Mayobridge Road at the Crown Bridges and Ashtree Cottages. According to local tradition, however, the entire waterway is known as the Clanrye.",

This river then joins with the Ballynahatty Water to form the Drumragh River.[1] Omagh is sited at the confluence of the Camowen, Strule and Drumragh Rivers. The Camowen and Drumragh Rivers actually meet at Omagh to form the River Strule. In 2006 a new Omagh Throughpass road scheme, developed at a cost of £9.7m, was opened. The project included a river bridge to carry the Throughpass over the Drumragh River.",

It rises as a tiny, fast-moving stream near to the summit of Slieve Croob; Transmitter Road runs nearby. From here it continues on its journey to Belfast through Dromara, Donaghcloney and Dromore. On the lower slopes of the mountain, it is joined by another branch from Legananny (Cratlieve) Mountain, just opposite Slieve Croob. At Dromara, about four miles from its source, its height above the sea is 390 ft (119m).",
